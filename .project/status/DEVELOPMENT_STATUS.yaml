development_rules:
- Only one AI/developer can be assigned to a task at a time
- Update this file when starting or completing tasks
- Tasks can only be started when all dependencies are completed
- Phase dependencies must be respected
- Higher priority (lower number) tasks should be completed first
- All changes must align with cost-optimization goals for personal trading systems
